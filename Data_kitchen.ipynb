       "1  awesome & self-ness i personally have 5 days sets and have also bought 2 sets for other people in my home. the two other sets i have decided to keep for myself. the purpose of keeping them for myself is to use them for other other than salt and pepper. they stay perfect, i use them constantly! i have a couple of people here that use them, say that there's just awesome. i did have a salt shaker that had a little problem converting from sea salt to himalaya salt.  did not fall out correctly so what i did was i just took a top of part which is really simple it's like five pieces total and just kind of cleaned around the teflon and you know that the salt buildup from there was caused by humidity,  cleaned out, my gosh it's unbelievable how much better, its almost better than new thank you bavaria these are top of the line in my book i hope in the near future you have some more come out.  i sure would like to buy some more and some for my kids and family for christmas otherwise i'm keeping what i have. i think i deserve it. thank you.... don't know if this makes much sense doesn't need to, self-ness !!!  \n",

       "3       what you should know before you buy! i was provided a freddie and sebbie freezable lunch bag/cooler bag free for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what i found.<br /><br />what you should know before you buy:<br />♦ this is a medium sized lunch bag/cooler bag.  large enough to hold quite a few items.<br />♦ this lunch bag has the reusable ice packs built right into the sides of the bag, so no fumbling around with ice packs that take up space in your typical bag.<br />♦ very nice quality and seems to be quite sturdy.<br />♦ did a great job of keeping my lunch cold at work.<br />♦ folds up pretty small with a velcro closure so it is easy to store in your freezer while you are waiting for it to cool off.<br />♦ has extra pockets on the sides.<br /><br />conclusion:<br />overall, this is great cooler bag/lunch bag.  this bag has the reusable ice packs that you normally put in the bag built right into the walls of the bag.  this is great because you don't have to take up bag space with separate ice packs or have to fumble through them to get to your food.  it has a really nice, compact design when folded, so it doesn't take up much space while it is sitting in your freezer cooling off.  when opened up, it holds quite a bit of food and drink items.  i take my lunch to work pretty much every day, so i gave this bag a try and it did a great job keeping my lunch perfectly cold.  we always take a small cooler or cooler bag with us on day trips that have lunch items and/or drinks for our family of four, and this bag can easily accommodate all of that.  if you are in the market for a lunch bag and the integrated ice packs sound like a feature you would like, this bag is a great choice.  \n",
